## what?
---
- barebones guitar emulator
- doesn't have any sound output **yet**

## why?
---
- tuxguitar's UI is sh\*t
- always wanted to do something like that
- learning cpp

## how?
---
- run the program
- "s|f" means "string and fret"
- under letter 's' input string number (e.g. 3)
- then leave a space and input fret number (e.g. 12)
- repeat this to the end of your song/melody/solo-lick
- press CTRL+D for Linux
- press CTRL+Z for wINDOWS
- and an animation of playing will be displayed 

## TODO
---
- find a way to play animation with **sound**
